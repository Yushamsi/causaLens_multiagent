# MCP Server Connection Test Results

## 🎯 Test Summary

Based on the test runs, here are the **actual results** of the MCP server connections:

### ✅ **WORKING COMPONENTS**

1. **MCP Imports** - ✅ **PASS**
   - `from mcp import StdioServerParameters` - Working
   - `from crewai_tools import MCPServerAdapter` - Working

2. **Filesystem MCP Server** - ✅ **PASS**
   - Server: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`
   - Status: Successfully initialized
   - Tools: 14 tools available
   - Command: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`

3. **Agents.py MCP Integration** - ✅ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**
   - Filesystem server: ✅ Working
   - Data exploration server: ❌ Not available (`mcp-server-data-exploration` not found)

4. **CrewAI with MCP Tools** - ✅ **PASS**
   - CrewAI agents can successfully use MCP tools
   - Filesystem tools integrate properly with CrewAI agents

### ❌ **ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

1. **Missing MCP Servers**:
   - `mcp-server-data-exploration` - Not found in package registry

2. **Connection Timeouts**:
   - Some servers fail to connect after 30 seconds
   - This is expected for servers that don't exist

## 📊 **DETAILED RESULTS**

### Test 1: MCP Imports
```
✅ MCP imports successful
```
**Status**: PASS

### Test 2: Filesystem MCP Server
```
✅ Filesystem MCP server initialized with 14 tools
```
**Status**: PASS
**Tools Available**: 14 filesystem-related tools

### Test 3: Agents.py Integration
```
✅ MCP Server filesystem initialized
❌ Failed to initialize data_exploration: Failed to initialize MCP Adapter
```
**Status**: PARTIAL SUCCESS
**Working Servers**: 1 out of 2
**Failed Servers**: 1 out of 2 (missing package)

### Test 4: CrewAI Integration
```
✅ CrewAI with MCP tools successful
```
**Status**: PASS

## 🔧 **SYSTEM STATUS**

### ✅ **What's Working**
1. **Core MCP Infrastructure**: Imports, server creation, basic connectivity
2. **Filesystem MCP Server**: Fully functional with 14 tools
3. **CrewAI Integration**: Agents can use MCP tools successfully
4. **Virtual Environment**: Properly configured with all dependencies

### ⚠️ **What Needs Attention**
1. **Missing MCP Servers**: Some servers are not available in the package registry
2. **Package Availability**: `mcp-server-data-exploration` needs to be installed separately

## 📋 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Core functionality is working** - The MCP system is functional
2. ✅ **Filesystem server is working** - Can be used for file operations
3. ⚠️ **Install missing servers** - Some MCP servers need separate installation

### Next Steps
1. **Use available servers**: The filesystem server provides 14 tools for file operations
2. **Install missing packages**: 
   ```bash
   # Try installing the missing server
   pip install mcp-server-data-exploration
   ```
3. **Test with working servers**: Focus on the filesystem server that is working

## 🎉 **CONCLUSION**

**The MCP server connections ARE working correctly!** 

- ✅ MCP imports work
- ✅ Filesystem server works (14 tools available)
- ✅ CrewAI integration works
- ✅ Virtual environment is properly configured

The only issue is that the `mcp-server-data-exploration` server is not available in the package registry, but this doesn't affect the core functionality.

**Your MCP setup is functional and ready to use!**
